    "text": "Experimental Design\nMain Hypothesis: The introduction of the ORP program decreased the opium cultivation by shifting labor out of opium cultivating regions.\nIdeal experimental design: Randomly pick villages and introduce ORP in some villages and leave rest of the villages as control group. Then check whether villages with ORP experience population increase.\nIssue:\n\nRandomization: The treatment are not received randomly. Villages are treated based on whether the village is suitable for business operations (i.e. low elevation, near road, etc.). Thus, we might want to characterize locations suitable for ORP alternative crop plantation, using distance to road, slope, and elevation.\n\nRefined Hypothesis: Controlling for geographic accessibility and baseline opium risk, village exposed to ORP experienced a greater reduction in opium cultivation compared to similar, non-treated villages.\nMechanism:\n\nFirst-order Impact\n\nLocal laborers shift from opium cultivation to wage labor on these plantations.\nFarmers/opium farmers migrate to ORP zones for better opportunities (replacement by displacement).\n\nSecond-order Impact\n\nSchooling and child labor: with stable ORP income, some households pull children from labor to school (Sviatschi 2022; UNODC 2005)\n\n\nORP likely impacted population dynamics in Laos, especially through the relocation of labor from upland opium-growing areas to lowland agricultural and economic centers. We will explore such dynamics in the following section to better characterize such characteristics and check the possibility of the ‘’replacement by displacement’’ mechanism.\nPopulation and Housing Census. To understand these changes, we first analyze Laos’ Population and Housing Census (2005) to establish a pre-ORP baseline. We assess how population, population density, and poverty levels relate to terrain characteristics (elevation, slope), road accessibility, and how they evolved between 2005 and 2015.\nWorld Pop. Then we will use WorldPop data, which is trained using machine learning technique to simulate the population distribution between 2000 and 2020. This will add additional information on the population dynamics to the Population Housing Census information which is limited to only 2005 and 2015.\nORP Program. Then we will check whether the observed population dynamic is affected by ORP programs using official ORP records."

While there is a ‘’linear’’ relationship between population distribution and topographic characteristics, population dynamic differ across elevation-slope group class before and after intervention.

Incorporating elevation and slope strengthens the estimated negative effect, especially in continuous-risk models. The binary topographic risk model becomes insignificant in the log specification, highlighting the importance of continuous measures."
